1. Find a way to convert to type dict from type str in data.txt (done- used import ast)
2. Format tweet to show current change (ie: Died: 1 added (Total: 43)) 
    - Now easier: read data.txt and convert to dict to easily call the key value pairs
3. tweet5 = Rate positivity case picture (tweet media)
4. Heroku implementation
    - Create a forever while loop
    while not_retweeted is True:
        - Check WHO profile for new tweet every 5 mins for COVID 19 stats
        - use import datetime as a search string for [day] [month]
        - Once retweeted
        not_retweeted = False
        While already_retweeted = True
            -time.sleep 24 hours?
            -use datetime to subtract remaining time of the day place it in variable
            -time.sleep(remaining_time_variable)
            not_retweeted = True
5. Add a log file for every when the bot detects a retweet
